# Discord Bot written in Swift
This bot will replace the existing one for the friends discord channel.
The main function of the bot is that it fetches news from DN.se.
There are two commands to get the news:
	- 'idag': fetches the latest 5 news from dn.se/nyhetsdygnet
	- 'bootycall': fetches the top 5 popular news from dn.se/
